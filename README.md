# üìù Basic Notes App

A simple command-line notes manager built in Python.  
This project was created to practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, methods, and basic data management.

## Features

- Create notes with a title, content, and timestamp  
- View all saved notes in a clean format  
- Edit the title or content of existing notes  
- Delete notes with confirmation prompts  
- User-friendly input validation  

## How It Works

When you start the program, you'll see a menu with options:  

    1. Create Note

    2. View Notes

    3. Edit Note

    4. Delete Note

    5. Exit

Notes are stored in memory during the session. Each note has:  

- **Title** ‚Üí Short text describing the note  
- **Content** ‚Üí The body of the note  
- **Created on** ‚Üí A timestamp when the note was added  

## Example

        1. Create Note

        2. View Notes

        3. Edit Note

        4. Delete Note

        5 Exit


        Choose an option (1-5): 1
        Enter note title: Shopping List

        Note created successfully.
